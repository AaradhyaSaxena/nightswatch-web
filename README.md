# AI Safety Chrome Extension: Protecting Corporate Data in the GenAI Era [WIP]
*(Night's Watch): The shield that guards the clipboard of men/women*

## Executive Summary
Our AI Safety Chrome Extension provides real-time protection against accidental data exposure in GenAI platforms, offering:
- 100% PII detection and masking
- $63,000+ monthly cost savings
- 10-day break-even period
- Zero-trust architecture with local processing
- Enterprise-grade compliance (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)

## VALUE
Primary Financial Impact 

- Average data breach cost: $4.45M (IBM Security Report 2023)
- Regulatory fines: Up to 4% of global revenue under GDPR
- Legal costs from PII exposure: $150-$350 per compromised record
- Potential revenue impact from trade secret exposure: Varies by industry, often >$10M
+ Business continuity cost: $1.5M per incident (Gartner)
+ Productivity loss from AI tool restrictions: $2,000/employee/year
